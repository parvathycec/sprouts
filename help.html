<ol><li>The game is played by two players</li>
<br/>
<li>Players take turns, where each turn consists of drawing a line between two spots (or from a spot to itself).</li>
<br/>
<li>The line must be a curve and must not touch or cross itself or any other line. This is important to remember!</li>
<br/>
<li> A spot cannot have more than three lines leading to or from it.</li>
<br/>
<li> The idea is to make it impossible for the other player to draw a line.</li> 
<br/>
<li>So the last person to draw a line is the winner.</li></ol>
